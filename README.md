# COVID-19-Data-Analysis---A-Machine-Learning-Case-Study
Data Analysis on Covid 19 time series dataset with prediction of an estimate of cases using Time Series models and Deep Learning architectures
 With the increasing concern for the upcoming scenarios in the coming times around the present pandemic, there has been an urge in the necessity of analysis and prediction of several parameters like covid case count, recovery rate, area-based information, safety-measure survey information, etc. These information and surveys can be put into use for the government, institutions and organizations to create an estimate of the resources, medication and facilities which might be required to be provided in the coming days.
   This project is a drive to analyze and predict effects of the current pandemic in the coming days based on existing and recently generated survey reports and extracted information using rich machine learning components such as regression,ARIMA,SARIMAX models and deep learning models to support organizations and institutions over anticipation of resource requirement in the later phases of the pandemic.
