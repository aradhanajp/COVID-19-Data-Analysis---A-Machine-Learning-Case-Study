# COVID-19-Data-Analysis---A-Machine-Learning-Case-Study
Data Analysis on Covid 19 time series dataset with prediction of an estimate of cases using Time Series models and Deep Learning architectures

 With the increasing concern for the upcoming scenarios in the coming times around the present pandemic, there has been an urge in the necessity of analysis and prediction of several parameters like covid case count, recovery rate, area-based information, safety-measure survey information, etc. These information and surveys can be put into use for the government, institutions and organizations to create an estimate of the resources, medication and facilities which might be required to be provided in the coming days.
   This‌ ‌project‌ ‌is‌ ‌a‌ ‌drive‌ ‌to‌ ‌analyse‌ ‌and‌ ‌predict‌ ‌effects‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌current‌ ‌pandemic‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌coming‌ ‌days‌ ‌based‌ ‌on‌ ‌existing‌ ‌and‌ ‌recently‌ ‌generated‌ ‌survey‌ ‌reports‌ ‌and‌ ‌extracted‌ ‌information‌ ‌using‌ ‌rich‌ ‌machine‌ ‌learning‌ ‌components‌, deep learning components  ‌such‌ ‌as‌ ARIMA and LSTM ‌models‌  ‌to‌ ‌support‌ ‌organisations‌ ‌and‌ ‌institutions‌ ‌over‌ ‌anticipation‌ ‌of‌ ‌resource‌ ‌requirement‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌later‌ ‌phases‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌pandemic.‌ ‌
   
Objectives:

-> Predict the number of COVID cases using Time Series Dataset
-> Use 2 different algorithms for prediction to get more insights.
